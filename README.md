A sketch to work with a 7-segment display and 8-bit shift register and a push button.<br />

The 7-segment displays numbers starting from *countStart* to *countEnd* with a delay equals to *countDelay* between each update.<br />

When the push button is pushed for a short period , counting reset happens.<br />
